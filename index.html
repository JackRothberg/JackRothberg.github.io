	My name is Jack Rothberg. I was born and raised in New York
  in a town called Beacon. I am the youngest of five children. I
	am currently studying Computer Science at the University at Buffalo.
	During my free time I enjoy playing sports, mainly soccer, and also watching
	them. I also like listening to rap and country music.
